# CSS Practice 1
## Context and Description
This project contains elements that respond to hover and clicks of the mouse and can add text to the page by clicking. I did this project to implement some HTML concepts I learned that respond to user interaction; Pseudo-class like 'hover' and 'active', onclick attributes that can call a JavaScript function.
